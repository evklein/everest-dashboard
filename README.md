# Everest

Everest is a lot of things. The most succinct way to describe it is that it is a tool built for my own interests. It functions as a 2nd brain, as well as a personal deployment platform that behaves like a faux-cloud when used in combination with Everest User Agents. There's no central aim or goal to Everest other than to provide me a working environment that I can use as a hub for other projects.

Everest boasts the following features, with more on the way:
* Notetaking
* ToDo list
* Admin page
* Project hub (In progress)
* Application/job deployment platform (In progress)

Future releases:
* Source control tracking
* Email service
* Profile page/settings
* Tag query
